- =, ==: The left-hand expression is equal to the right-hand expression.
- >=, =>: The left-hand expression is greater than or equal to the right-hand expression.
- <=, =<: The left-hand expression is less than or equal to the right-hand expression.
- >: The left-hand expression is greater than the right-hand expression.
- <: The left-hand expression is less than the right-hand expression.
- !=, <>: The left-hand expression is not equal to the right-hand expression.
- BETWEEN: The left-hand expression is between, or equal to either of, the values specified in the right-hand side. The right-hand side is a two value array (an array is required to specify order) giving upper and lower bounds. For example, 1 BETWEEN { 0 , 33 }, or $INPUT BETWEEN { $LOWER, $UPPER }.
