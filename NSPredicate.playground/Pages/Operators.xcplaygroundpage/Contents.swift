# Predicate Comparison Operators

- `=`, `==` The left-hand expression is equal to the right-hand expression.
- `>=`, `=>` The left-hand expression is greater than or equal to the right-hand expression.
- `<=`, `=<` The left-hand expression is less than or equal to the right-hand expression.
- `>`The left-hand expression is greater than the right-hand expression.
- `<` The left-hand expression is less than the right-hand expression.
- `!=`, `<>` The left-hand expression is not equal to the right-hand expression.
- `BETWEEN` The left-hand expression is between, or equal to either of, the values specified in the right-hand side. The right-hand side is a two value array (an array is required to specify order) giving upper and lower bounds. For example, `1 BETWEEN { 0 , 33 }`, or `$INPUT BETWEEN { $LOWER, $UPPER }`.
